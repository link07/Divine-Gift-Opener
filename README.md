# Divine-Gift-Opener

Program I created a while back to open Archeage Divine Gifts, I eventually tacked on the 'feature' of left or right clicking anywhere on screen every x minutes on Windows.
On 5/19/2015 I renamed it from "Divine Gift Opener" to "Interval Click", and reworked the code to follow that more

Used heavily on Windows 7

Tested a bit on Windows 8, though it seems to not always interpret clicks in 8 (This might be the laptop I was using)

# Compile Notes
Include "System.Drawing" and "System.Windows.Forms"
Also includes optional icon
